Please make sure to use:
1. Bootstrap framework or any other popular CSS framework you like
2. SASS (and also attach compiled CSS)
3. Must be responsive and tested on popular browsers/resolutions (try browserstack.com)
4. IE11+, Latest Chrome and Firefox needs to be supported
5. Using gulp/npm/bower/livereload/browsersync or any other tool is an additional plus
6. Any custom animations/easings/UI improvements are more than welcome
7. Same elements used in multiple locations should use similar markup/class
8. Short CSS selectors are easier to maintain - do not over complicate things
9. Properly styled component should work and look properly even if placed in other sections/containers
10. Whenever possible, please use proper Bootstrap markup for common elements like breadcrumbs, media objects, progress bars etc.
11. Icons - please make sure to use font-face for icons ex. Font Awesome
12. Media queries - please make sure to use proper breakpoints ex. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid-media-queries
